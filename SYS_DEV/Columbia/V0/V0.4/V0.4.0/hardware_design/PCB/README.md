## PCB
1. Designed symbol and footprint for DW01 battery protection IC.
2. Designed symbol and footprint for FS8205A dual channel MOSFET IC.
3. Updated schematic and PCB to include DW01 and FS8205A ICs with accompanying resistors and capacitors.
4. New design will protect LiPo battery from overdischarge due to low voltage.

## To do from May 19th meeting

### Ryan
1. Need to rework the file so content from ``smart penetrometer update-rescue.kicad_sym'' is moved to a better place. 
1. Get rid of all these files with resuce and backup in the name. 
1. Can add files extensions to the .gitignore thatn we don't need.
