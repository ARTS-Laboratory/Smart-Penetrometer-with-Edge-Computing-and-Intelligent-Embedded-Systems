# Hardware Design
## [CAD](CAD)
### Fusion360 CAD models of sensor node structure

## [PCB](PCB)
### KiCad schematic, PCB, footprints, etc

## [Base](https://github.com/ARTS-Laboratory/Smart-Penetrometer-with-Edge-Computing-and-Intelligent-Embedded-Systems/tree/main/System_development/Columbia/V0/V0.6/V0.6.0/hardware_design/Base%20Station/SPECIES_receiver)
### KiCad schematic, PCB
### NOTE: In the schematic, I label the connections using flag labels rather than wires/lines, so every single matching label gets connected to each other, resulting in a bigger rats nest than necessary. We canâ€™t connect those as then that would be connecting the nRF modules to each other.
